Locations represent the physical sites where your robots operate. Each location can have multiple areas (floors, sections, buildings) with their own maps and configurations.

## Understanding the Hierarchy

```
Organization
├── Location: "Austin Warehouse"
│   ├── Area: "Floor 1"
│   │   ├── Map: floor1-map.png
│   │   ├── Zones: Shipping, Receiving, Restricted
│   │   └── Waypoints: Dock-1, Dock-2, Charging-A
│   ├── Area: "Floor 2"
│   │   └── Map: floor2-map.png
│   └── Area: "Loading Dock"
│       └── Map: dock-map.png
│
└── Location: "Boston Store"
    ├── Area: "Sales Floor"
    └── Area: "Back Room"
```

## Setting Up Locations

### Create a Location

1. Go to the **Locations** dashboard
2. Click **Add Location**
3. Enter location details:
   - **Name** - Unique, descriptive name
   - **Address** - Physical address (optional)
   - **Time Zone** - For accurate timestamps
   - **Description** - Additional context
4. Save

### Add Areas to a Location

1. Click on a location to open the editor
2. Click **Add Area**
3. Configure the area:
   - **Name** - e.g., "Floor 1", "East Wing"
   - **Description** - What this area contains
   - **Default** - Set as default area for this location
4. Add a map to the area
5. Save

## Managing Maps

Each area should have at least one map for robot visualization and navigation.

### Upload a Map Image

1. Open the area in the Locations editor
2. Click **Upload Map**
3. Select an image file (PNG, JPG, SVG)
4. Set the map scale:
   - Click two points on the map
   - Enter the real-world distance between them
5. Set origin and orientation if needed
6. Save

### Import from Robot

If your robot has SLAM capability:
1. Open the area in the editor
2. Click **Import from Robot**
3. Select the robot
4. Choose the map to import
5. The map is added to the area

### Map Alignment

When robots have their own maps that differ from the floor plan:

1. Go to the area's map settings
2. Click **Map Aligner**
3. Select the robot whose map to align
4. Use visual landmarks to align:
   - Drag to position
   - Rotate to orient
   - Scale if needed
5. Save the alignment

<Tip>
  Use permanent features like walls and doorways for alignment—not furniture or movable objects.
</Tip>

## Zones and Waypoints

### Zones

Define areas with special meaning or rules:

| Zone Type | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Restricted** | Robots cannot enter |
| **Speed Limit** | Robots slow down |
| **Pickup** | Item collection points |
| **Dropoff** | Delivery destinations |
| **Charging** | Charging station areas |
| **Danger** | Safety-critical areas |

**To create a zone:**
1. Open the map in edit mode
2. Click **Add Zone**
3. Draw the zone boundary
4. Select zone type
5. Configure zone rules
6. Save

### Waypoints

Named positions for navigation:

**To create a waypoint:**
1. Open the map in edit mode
2. Click **Add Waypoint**
3. Click the position on the map
4. Name the waypoint
5. Set waypoint type (optional)
6. Save

**Waypoint naming conventions:**
```
# Good examples
Charging-Station-A
Shipping-Dock-1
Elevator-Floor2
Entrance-Main

# Be consistent across locations
```

## Assigning Robots to Locations

Robots can be assigned to locations for:
- Filtering in dashboards
- Location-specific configurations
- Access control

### Assign via Settings

1. Go to **Settings** → **Robots**
2. Select a robot
3. Set the **Location** field
4. Save

### Assign via Robot Dashboard

1. Open the Robot dashboard
2. Go to robot settings
3. Select location from dropdown
4. Save

### Bulk Assignment

1. In Fleet dashboard, select multiple robots
2. Use bulk action menu
3. Choose **Assign to Location**
4. Select the location
5. Confirm

## Multi-Location Operations

### Filtering by Location

All dashboards support location filtering:
- Fleet dashboard → Location dropdown
- Reports → Filter by location
- Incidents → Location-specific views

### Location-Based Permissions

<Info>
  Location-based access control is available in **Enterprise** edition.
</Info>

Restrict users to specific locations:
1. Go to **Settings** → **Users**
2. Edit user
3. Set **Allowed Locations**
4. User only sees robots at those locations

### Cross-Location Views

For managers overseeing multiple locations:
- Use "All Locations" filter
- Create dashboards showing location comparisons
- Set up location-aggregated KPIs

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use clear naming">
    "Austin Distribution Center - Floor 1" is better than "Location A - Area 1".
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Update maps when layouts change">
    Outdated maps cause navigation issues. Schedule regular map reviews.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Define zones before deployment">
    Set up restricted and speed-limit zones before robots go live.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Standardize waypoint naming">
    Use consistent naming across all locations for easier training and automation.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Document your locations">
    Keep a record of area purposes, map sources, and special configurations.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
