Collections and tags help you organize and filter your robot fleet. They're essential for managing robots at scale.

## Collections

Collections are static groups of robots. A robot can belong to multiple collections.

### Creating Collections

1. Go to **Settings** → **Collections**
2. Click **Create Collection**
3. Enter collection details:
   - **Name** - Unique identifier
   - **Description** - Purpose of this collection
   - **Color** - Visual indicator (optional)
4. Add robots to the collection
5. Save

### Use Cases for Collections

| Collection Type | Example | Purpose |
|-----------------|---------|---------|
| **By Function** | "Delivery Bots", "Cleaning Bots" | Group by robot purpose |
| **By Location** | "Building A", "Floor 2" | Group by physical area |
| **By Customer** | "Acme Corp", "TechCo" | Multi-tenant deployments |
| **By Shift** | "Day Shift", "Night Shift" | Time-based operations |
| **By Status** | "Production", "Testing" | Deployment stage |

### Managing Collections

**Add robots to a collection:**
1. Open the collection in Settings
2. Click **Add Robots**
3. Select robots from the list
4. Save

**Remove robots:**
1. Open the collection
2. Find the robot
3. Click the remove icon
4. Save

**Bulk operations:**
- Select multiple robots in Fleet view
- Use the bulk action menu
- Choose "Add to Collection"

### Using Collections in Dashboards

Filter any dashboard by collection:
1. Look for the **Collection** dropdown (usually top-left)
2. Select a collection
3. Dashboard shows only robots in that collection

<Tip>
  Save filtered views as bookmarks for quick access to specific collections.
</Tip>

## Tags

Tags are flexible labels that can be applied to robots. Unlike collections, tags can be:
- Applied dynamically via API
- Changed based on robot state
- Used in automation rules

### Creating Tags

Tags are created when you first apply them to a robot:
1. Open a robot's settings or Robot dashboard
2. Find the **Tags** section
3. Type a new tag name
4. Press Enter to create and apply

Or create tags in advance:
1. Go to **Settings** → **Tags**
2. Click **Create Tag**
3. Enter name and optional color
4. Save

### Tag Naming Conventions

Use consistent naming for easier management:

```
# Good
maintenance-due
high-priority
needs-calibration

# Avoid
Maintenance Due (spaces)
HighPriority (inconsistent case)
temp123 (unclear meaning)
```

### Dynamic Tagging via API

Tags can be applied/removed programmatically:

```bash
# Add tag via API
curl -X POST https://api.inorbit.ai/robots/{robotId}/tags \
  -H "x-auth-inorbit-app-key: YOUR_KEY" \
  -d '{"tag": "maintenance-due"}'

# Remove tag
curl -X DELETE https://api.inorbit.ai/robots/{robotId}/tags/maintenance-due \
  -H "x-auth-inorbit-app-key: YOUR_KEY"
```

### Using Tags in Filters

Filter dashboards and reports by tags:
- Fleet dashboard → Tag filter
- Reports → Filter by tag
- Incident rules → Apply to tagged robots

### Tags in Automation

Use tags to trigger workflows:
- "When robot is tagged `low-battery`, alert operator"
- "When `high-priority` tag is present, prioritize in queue"

## Collections vs Tags

| Aspect | Collections | Tags |
|--------|-------------|------|
| **Membership** | Static (manual changes) | Dynamic (can change via API) |
| **Purpose** | Organizational hierarchy | Flexible categorization |
| **Multiple** | Robot in multiple collections | Robot has multiple tags |
| **Visibility** | Dropdown in dashboards | Filter/search |
| **Use case** | "This robot belongs to Team A" | "This robot needs maintenance" |

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use collections for structure">
    Collections should reflect your organizational structure—locations, teams, or functions that don't change often.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use tags for state">
    Tags work well for temporary or changing states like "needs-attention", "new-firmware", or "testing".
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Be consistent">
    Establish naming conventions and document them. Inconsistent naming leads to confusion.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Don't over-tag">
    Too many tags become meaningless. Keep tags purposeful.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Review periodically">
    Audit collections and tags regularly. Remove unused ones.
