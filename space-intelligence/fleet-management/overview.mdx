description: "Organize and manage your robot fleet effectively"
---

Fleet management in InOrbit helps you organize robots, track their operations, and manage them at scale. Whether you have 5 robots or 500, these tools keep your fleet organized and efficient.

## Core Concepts

### Collections

**Collections** are groups of robots that you define for easier management. Use collections to:
- Filter dashboards to specific robot groups
- Apply configurations to multiple robots
- Generate reports for robot subsets
- Assign permissions by robot group

Examples:
- "Delivery Bots" - All delivery robots
- "Building A" - Robots in a specific location
- "Night Shift" - Robots operating at night

### Tags

**Tags** are labels you can apply to robots for flexible categorization:
- Robots can have multiple tags
- Tags can be applied/removed dynamically
- Filter and search by tags
- Use in incident rules and automation

Examples:
- `high-priority`, `maintenance-due`, `testing`

### Locations

**Locations** represent physical sites where robots operate:
- Warehouses, hospitals, retail stores
- Each location can have multiple areas (floors, sections)
- Robots are assigned to locations
- Dashboards can filter by location

## How They Work Together

```
Fleet (all robots)
├── Collection: "East Coast"
│   ├── Location: NYC Warehouse
│   │   └── Robots: bot-1, bot-2 (tags: delivery)
│   └── Location: Boston Store
│       └── Robots: bot-3 (tags: cleaning)
└── Collection: "West Coast"
    └── Location: LA Distribution
        └── Robots: bot-4, bot-5 (tags: delivery, high-priority)
```
