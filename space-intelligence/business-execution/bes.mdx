**InOrbit Business Execution System™ (BES)** captures your business rules and processes and translates them into detailed, on-demand missions for your robot fleet. By connecting enterprise systems with robotic operations, BES enables software-defined, end-to-end automation that reduces deployment time and increases operational efficiency.

## What BES Does

BES takes orders from your enterprise systems—ERPs, WMSs, and other business applications—and translates them into missions carried out by robots. It handles optimization, scheduling, and execution to keep your operations running smoothly.

## Business Outcomes

| For End Users | For Systems Integrators |
|---------------|------------------------|
| Increase operational efficiency by integrating automation technologies | Tackle more integration projects with reduced staff allocation |
| Reduce time to integrate enterprise systems with robotics | Differentiate from traditional hardware-based integrations |
| Gain visibility through a single pane of glass | Add robotics expertise to digital transformation projects |
| Enable continuous improvement through configuration changes | Create recurring revenue opportunities |

## Enterprise Integration

BES connects with your existing enterprise infrastructure:

- **Warehouse Management Systems (WMS)** — Receive pick, put, and transport orders
- **Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)** — Align robot operations with production schedules
- **Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES)** — Coordinate with production workflows

## How It Works

1. **Orders arrive** from your enterprise systems via API
2. **BES translates** orders into one or more robot missions based on your configured business rules
3. **Missions are queued** and scheduled based on priority, timing, and robot availability
4. **Robots execute** the missions, reporting progress back to BES
5. **Status flows back** to your enterprise systems for complete visibility
