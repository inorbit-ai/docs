Dashboards are the primary interface for interacting with your robots in InOrbit Control. Each dashboard is a collection of widgets that display data and provide controls for your robot fleet.

## Default Dashboards

InOrbit comes with four pre-configured dashboards:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Locations" icon="building" href="/space-intelligence/dashboards/locations">
    Configure your physical sites, upload maps, and define zones and waypoints.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Fleet" icon="robot" href="/space-intelligence/dashboards/fleet">
    Bird's-eye view of your entire fleet's health and status.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Robot" icon="microchip" href="/space-intelligence/dashboards/robot">
    Deep dive into individual robot details, vitals, and actions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Navigation" icon="route" href="/space-intelligence/dashboards/navigation">
    Real-time robot navigation with map and camera views.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Dashboard Components

Every dashboard consists of:

### Widgets

Individual components that display specific information or controls:
- **Data widgets** - Show metrics, charts, timelines
- **Map widgets** - Display robot positions and paths
- **Action widgets** - Buttons to control robots
- **Status widgets** - Health indicators and alerts

### Layout

Widgets can be arranged in a grid layout:
- Drag to reorder
- Resize to fit your needs
- Add/remove as needed

### Filters

Many dashboards support filtering by:
- Robot name or ID
- Collection or tag
- Location
- Time range

## Customizing Dashboards

<Note>
  Dashboard customization requires **Owner** or **Administrator** role.
</Note>

### Adding Widgets

1. Enter edit mode (click the edit icon)
2. Click **Add Widget**
3. Select widget type from the catalog
4. Configure widget settings
5. Position and resize as needed
6. Save changes

### Available Widget Types

| Widget | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Timeline** | Historical data over time |
| **Map** | Robot position and navigation |
| **Vitals** | Battery, CPU, memory, disk |
| **Modes & Tags** | Current robot state |
| **Actions** | Execute robot commands |
| **Robot Log** | Recent log entries |
| **Camera** | Live video feed |
| **KPI** | Key performance indicators |
| **Incidents** | Active alerts and issues |
| **Fleet Status** | Fleet-wide overview |

### Creating New Dashboards

1. Go to **Settings** → **Dashboards**
2. Click **Create Dashboard**
3. Name your dashboard
4. Add widgets and configure layout
5. Set visibility (which roles can see it)
6. Save and publish

<Tip>
  Start by duplicating an existing dashboard and modifying it rather than building from scratch.
</Tip>

## Dashboard Permissions

Control who sees which dashboards:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Visibility** | Which roles can access the dashboard |
| **Default** | Show in navigation by default |
| **Position** | Order in the dashboard list |

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Design for your audience">
    Operators need quick status views. Engineers need detailed diagnostics. Create role-specific dashboards.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Keep it focused">
    Don't overload dashboards with too many widgets. Group related information logically.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use collections">
    Filter dashboards by robot collections to focus on specific groups.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Set meaningful defaults">
    Configure widgets to show the most relevant data by default.
  </Accordion>
