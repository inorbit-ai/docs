description: "Configure and manage your physical sites, areas, and maps"
---

The Locations dashboard allows you to configure powerful operational rules for your sites. Each location represents a physical facility where your robots operate, and can contain multiple areas (like different floors or sections).

## Understanding Locations Structure

```
Location (e.g., "Warehouse Alpha")
├── Area 1 (e.g., "Floor 1")
│   ├── Map (floor plan or robot-generated)
│   ├── Zones (pickup, dropoff, restricted)
│   └── Waypoints (navigation targets)
├── Area 2 (e.g., "Floor 2")
│   └── ...
└── Area 3 (e.g., "Loading Dock")
    └── ...
```

## Locations List View

The main Locations dashboard shows all your configured locations:

- **Location name** - Identifier for the site
- **Area count** - Number of areas defined
- **Robot count** - Robots assigned to this location
- **Status** - Configuration completeness

Click on any location to open the **Locations Editor**.

## Locations Editor

The editor lets you manage a location's configuration:

### Adding Areas

1. Click **Add Area**
2. Name the area (e.g., "Floor 1", "East Wing")
3. Set as default area if applicable
4. Configure area-specific settings

### Managing Maps

Each area can have one or more maps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload a Map">
    Upload an image of your floor plan (PNG, JPG, or SVG).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Or Import from Robot">
    Import a map directly from one of your robots that has mapping capability.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Scale">
    Define the real-world dimensions to enable accurate positioning.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set as Default">
    Choose which map to display by default for this area.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Map Alignment

When viewing multiple robots on a shared map, use the **Map Aligner** tool:

1. Select the robot whose map you want to align
2. The aligner shows both the robot's map and the default map
3. Drag, rotate, and scale to visually align landmarks
4. Save the alignment

<Tip>
  Align maps using clear landmarks like walls, doorways, or pillars that appear in both maps.
</Tip>

## Annotating Maps

Once you have a default map, you can add annotations:

### Waypoints

Named positions that robots can navigate to:
- **Pickup points** - Where robots collect items
- **Dropoff points** - Where robots deliver items  
- **Charging stations** - Where robots recharge
- **Home positions** - Default robot positions

To add a waypoint:
1. Click **Add Waypoint**
2. Click the position on the map
3. Name the waypoint
4. Set waypoint type and properties

### Zones

Areas with special meaning or rules:

| Zone Type | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Restricted** | Robots should avoid this area |
| **Speed limit** | Robots slow down here |
| **Pickup** | Item collection area |
| **Dropoff** | Item delivery area |
| **Charging** | Charging station area |
| **Custom** | User-defined zones |

To add a zone:
1. Click **Add Zone**
2. Draw the zone boundary on the map
3. Name the zone
4. Select zone type and configure rules

## Assigning Robots to Locations

Robots can be assigned to locations for:
- Filtering in Fleet dashboard
- Location-specific configurations
- Multi-site fleet management

To assign robots:
1. Go to location settings
2. Click **Manage Robots**
3. Select robots to assign
4. Save changes

## Multi-Site Management

For organizations with multiple facilities:

- Each location operates independently
- Dashboards can filter by location
- Reports can aggregate across locations
- Users can be restricted to specific locations

<Info>
  Multi-site management with location-based access control is available in **Enterprise** edition.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use meaningful names">
    Name locations and areas clearly (e.g., "Austin Warehouse - Floor 2" not "Location 1").
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Keep maps up to date">
    Update maps when facility layouts change to ensure accurate robot positioning.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Define zones early">
    Set up restricted zones and speed limits before deploying robots in production.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use consistent waypoint naming">
    Establish naming conventions for waypoints across locations.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
