---

The Fleet dashboard provides a bird's-eye view of your entire robot fleet. It shows an overview of real-time fleet health, making it easy to identify robots that need attention.

## Robot Fleet View

The main widget displays a table overview of all your robots based on key characteristics:

### Status Indicators

Robots are color-coded by status:
- 🔴 **Red** - Error requiring immediate attention
- 🟡 **Yellow** - Warning that should be investigated
- 🔵 **Blue** - OK, operating normally

<Note>
  In the default sort (by status), robots with errors and warnings appear first for immediate visibility.
</Note>

### Default Characteristics

| Characteristic | What It Shows |
|----------------|---------------|
| **Battery** | Current charge level |
| **Disk Usage** | Storage capacity used |
| **RAM Usage** | Memory utilization |
| **Diagnostics** | ROS diagnostics status |
| **Localization** | Position confidence |
| **ROS Status** | ROS node health |
| **Payload Weight** | Current load (if applicable) |

## Filtering & Grouping

### Filter by Collection

If robot collections have been defined, use the collections dropdown to view specific groups:

```
Fleet > All Robots
Fleet > Delivery Bots
Fleet > Cleaning Bots
Fleet > Building A
```

<Tip>
  Collections help you organize robots by function, location, customer, or any criteria meaningful to your operations.
</Tip>

### Group By

Organize the fleet view by selecting a grouping:

| Group By | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Ungrouped** | All robots in a single list (default) |
| **Location** | Group by physical location |
| **Hardware** | Group by robot type/model |
| **Customer** | Group by customer assignment |
| **Mode** | Group by current operational mode |

### Mode Groupings

When grouped by mode, robots are organized by their current state:
- **Idle** - Not currently tasked
- **Charging** - At charging station
- **On Mission** - Executing a task
- **Manual** - Under manual control
- **Error** - In error state

## Reading the Fleet Table

### Columns (Robots)

Each column represents one robot:
- Robot name at the bottom
- Current mode displayed beneath the name
- Scroll horizontally to see more robots

### Rows (Characteristics)

Each row shows a specific characteristic across all robots:
- Color indicates status (red/yellow/blue)
- Click a cell to see details

## Quick Actions

From the Fleet dashboard, you can:

- **Click a robot** to open its Robot dashboard
- **Hover for details** to see specific values
- **Filter by status** to focus on problem robots
- **Export data** for reporting

## Customizing the Fleet View

Administrators can customize which characteristics appear:

1. Enter edit mode
2. Open widget settings
3. Select characteristics to display
4. Reorder as needed
5. Save changes

### Adding Custom Characteristics

If your robots report custom data, you can add it to the fleet view:
- Custom key-value attributes
- Integration-specific metrics
- Computed values

## Incidents Integration

The Fleet dashboard can show incident indicators:
- Robots with active incidents are highlighted
- Click to see incident details
- Resolve incidents directly from the dashboard

## Best Practices

  <Accordion title="Set up alerts">
    Don't rely solely on visual monitoring—configure incident alerts for critical conditions.
