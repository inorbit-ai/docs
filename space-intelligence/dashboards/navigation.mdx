---

The Navigation dashboard lets you monitor a robot's movement via map and camera views, along with key data relevant during navigation. It's designed for real-time monitoring and intervention when needed.

## Dashboard Layout

The Navigation dashboard typically includes:

- **Map View** - Robot position and planned path
- **Camera View** - Live video feed from the robot
- **Vitals** - Key metrics like battery and speed
- **Navigation Controls** - Commands for directing the robot

## Robot Selector

Use the robot selector in the upper left to switch between robots. This allows quick monitoring of different robots without leaving the dashboard.

## Map Widget

The map shows:

### Robot Position
- Current robot location (icon on map)
- Orientation/heading
- Position confidence indicator

### Navigation Path
- Planned route (when navigating)
- Waypoints along the route
- Obstacles detected

### Map Features
- Zones (restricted, speed limit, etc.)
- Waypoints (named destinations)
- Other robots (if multiple in same area)

### Map Controls
- **Zoom** - In/out for detail or overview
- **Pan** - Move around the map
- **Center on robot** - Return view to robot
- **Toggle layers** - Show/hide zones, paths, etc.

## Camera View

Live video feed from the robot's camera:

- Front camera (navigation view)
- Rear camera (if available)
- Additional cameras (robot-dependent)

### Hi-Rez Mode

<Note>
  Hi-Rez mode is an optional feature that can be requested.
</Note>

Toggle the **Hi-rez** button to temporarily improve video quality:
- Higher resolution stream
- Useful for detailed inspection
- Consumes more bandwidth

## Navigation Controls

Send navigation commands directly from the dashboard:

### Go To Waypoint
1. Select a waypoint from the list
2. Click **Navigate**
3. Robot plans and executes route

### Click-to-Navigate
1. Click a point on the map
2. Confirm the destination
3. Robot navigates to that position

### Cancel Navigation
Stop the current navigation task:
- Click **Cancel** or **Stop**
- Robot halts and awaits further instructions

### Manual Override

<Warning>
  Manual control requires appropriate permissions and should be used carefully.
</Warning>

Some robots support manual control:
- Joystick-style directional control
- Speed adjustment
- Rotation control

## Real-Time Data

Key metrics displayed during navigation:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Speed** | Current velocity |
| **Battery** | Remaining charge |
| **Distance** | To destination |
| **ETA** | Estimated arrival time |
| **Localization** | Position confidence |
| **Obstacles** | Detected obstructions |

## Mission Context

If the robot is on a mission:
- Mission name and status
- Current task in mission
- Progress indicator
- Mission timeline

## Multi-Robot View

For monitoring multiple robots simultaneously:
- Open multiple browser tabs
- Use picture-in-picture mode
- Create a multi-robot dashboard (Enterprise)

<Info>
  Multi-robot navigation monitoring with synchronized views is available in **Enterprise** edition.
</Info>

## Alerts During Navigation

The dashboard highlights issues:
- 🔴 **Navigation failed** - Cannot reach destination
- 🟡 **Obstacle detected** - Replanning route
- 🟡 **Low battery** - May need to charge
- 🔴 **Localization lost** - Robot is uncertain of position

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Monitor actively during critical tasks">
    Keep the Navigation dashboard open during important deliveries or in busy environments.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use waypoints, not coordinates">
    Named waypoints are easier to use and verify than raw coordinates.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Check camera before remote navigation">
    Use the camera to verify the robot's surroundings before sending navigation commands.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Have a cancel plan">
    Know how to quickly stop navigation if something goes wrong.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Space` | Pause/resume navigation |
| `Esc` | Cancel current navigation |
| `C` | Center map on robot |
| `+` / `-` | Zoom in/out |
| `←` `→` | Previous/next robot |
