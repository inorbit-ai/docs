Mission tracking gives you visibility into what your robots are doing, from task assignment through completion. Track deliveries, cleaning routes, patrols, and any other robot tasks.

## What Is a Mission?

A **mission** is a task assigned to a robot with:
- **Start time** - When the mission began
- **Status** - Scheduled, In Progress, Completed, Failed
- **Progress** - Percentage complete
- **Metadata** - Custom fields like destination, payload, priority

## Mission Lifecycle

```
Scheduled → In Progress → Completed
                ↓
              Failed
```

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Scheduled** | Mission created, not yet started |
| **In Progress** | Robot is executing the mission |
| **Completed** | Mission finished successfully |
| **Failed** | Mission could not be completed |

## Viewing Missions

### Mission Widget

The Mission widget shows:
- Current mission (if any)
- Mission name/label
- Progress percentage
- Time elapsed
- Mission metadata

### Mission Timeline

View historical missions:
- Filter by robot, time range, or status
- See mission duration and outcomes
- Identify patterns and issues

### Mission Dashboard

A dedicated view for mission operations:
- Active missions across fleet
- Mission queue
- Completion statistics

## Creating Missions

Missions can be created through:

### REST API

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.inorbit.ai/missions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-auth-inorbit-app-key: YOUR_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "robotId": "robot-123",
    "label": "Delivery to Dock 5",
    "arguments": {
      "destination": "Dock-5",
      "priority": "high"
    }
  }'
```

Response includes the `missionId` for tracking.

### Data Sources

Configure automatic mission creation from robot data:
- When robot enters "delivery" mode → create mission
- When specific topic is published → start mission
- Mission data flows from robot to InOrbit

<Tip>
  Data source integration is ideal when robots already track their own tasks.
</Tip>

## Updating Missions

### Via API

Update mission progress:

```bash
curl -X PUT https://api.inorbit.ai/missions/{missionId} \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-auth-inorbit-app-key: YOUR_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "inProgress": true,
    "completedPercent": 0.66
  }'
```

### Complete a Mission

```bash
curl -X PUT https://api.inorbit.ai/missions/{missionId} \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-auth-inorbit-app-key: YOUR_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "inProgress": false,
    "state": "completed",
    "completedPercent": 1.0
  }'
```

### Via Data Sources

Configure data sources to update missions:
- Progress from robot sensors
- Status from robot state machine
- Completion from mode changes

## Mission Metadata

Missions can include custom data:

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **label** | Human-readable mission name |
| **arguments** | Custom key-value data |
| **state** | Mission state |
| **status** | OK, Warning, Error |
| **completedPercent** | Progress 0.0 to 1.0 |

### Example with Metadata

```json
{
  "robotId": "robot-123",
  "label": "Aisle 5-10 Cleaning",
  "arguments": {
    "area": "Zone A",
    "priority": "normal",
    "estimated_duration": 1800,
    "assigned_by": "scheduler"
  }
}
```

## Mission Analytics

Track mission performance:

### KPIs
- Missions completed per hour/day
- Average mission duration
- Success rate
- Missions per robot

### Reports
- Mission history export
- Performance trends
- Failure analysis

<Info>
  Advanced mission analytics and custom KPIs are available in **Standard** and **Enterprise** editions.
</Info>

## Integration Patterns

### External Scheduler

```
Your Scheduler → API: Create Mission → InOrbit
                                          ↓
Your Scheduler ← Webhook: Mission Complete
```

### Robot-Driven

```
Robot publishes mode → InOrbit detects → Mission created
Robot updates status → InOrbit updates → Mission progress
Robot changes mode   → InOrbit detects → Mission completed
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use meaningful labels">
    "Delivery to Room 302" is better than "Mission-12345".
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Track progress">
    Update `completedPercent` for long missions so operators see progress.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Include context">
    Add relevant metadata (destination, priority, requester) for better reporting.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Handle failures">
    Always set appropriate state when missions fail for accurate analytics.
