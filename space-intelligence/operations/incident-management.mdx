InOrbit's incident management helps you detect issues with your robots, alert the right people, and track resolution. From battery warnings to navigation failures, incidents keep your team informed.

## What Are Incidents?

An **incident** is a notable event that requires attention:
- **Warning** - Something may need attention soon
- **Error** - Something is wrong and needs action
- **Critical** - Immediate action required

Incidents are triggered by conditions you define, like:
- Battery below 15%
- Robot offline for more than 5 minutes
- Navigation failure
- Temperature exceeding threshold

## Viewing Incidents

### Incident Dashboard

The Incident dashboard shows:
- **Active incidents** - Currently unresolved
- **Recent incidents** - Recently triggered or resolved
- **Incident timeline** - History over time

### Incident Indicators

Incidents appear throughout InOrbit:
- Fleet dashboard - Red/yellow robot indicators
- Robot dashboard - Incident widget
- Notifications - Alerts to your channels

## Incident Lifecycle

```
Triggered → Active → Acknowledged → Resolved
              ↓
         Escalated (if unacknowledged)
```

1. **Triggered** - Condition met, incident created
2. **Active** - Incident is ongoing
3. **Acknowledged** - Someone is aware and working on it
4. **Resolved** - Issue is fixed (automatically or manually)

## Responding to Incidents

### Acknowledge

When you start investigating an incident:
1. Open the incident
2. Click **Acknowledge**
3. Add optional notes
4. Incident shows "In Progress"

### Resolve

When the issue is fixed:
1. Open the incident
2. Click **Resolve**
3. Select resolution reason:
   - **Fixed** - Issue was corrected
   - **False Positive** - Not actually an issue
   - **Won't Fix** - Accepted as-is
4. Add resolution notes
5. Incident is closed

### Auto-Resolution

Some incidents resolve automatically when the condition clears:
- Battery incident resolves when battery rises above threshold
- Offline incident resolves when robot reconnects

## Configuring Incidents

<Note>
  Incident configuration requires **Administrator** role. For detailed configuration, see [Incident Definitions](/ground-control/configuration/kinds/incident-definitions).
</Note>

### Basic Configuration

1. Go to **Settings** → **Incidents**
2. Click **Create Incident Definition**
3. Configure:
   - **Name** - "Low Battery Warning"
   - **Severity** - Warning, Error, or Critical
   - **Condition** - When to trigger
   - **Message** - What to display
4. Set notification channels
5. Save

### Example Incidents

| Incident | Condition | Severity |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| Low Battery | battery < 15% | Warning |
| Critical Battery | battery < 5% | Critical |
| Robot Offline | disconnected > 5min | Error |
| High Temperature | temp > 80°C | Error |
| Localization Lost | localization_score < 0.5 | Warning |
| Mission Failed | mission_status = failed | Error |

## Alert Channels

When incidents trigger, notify through:

### In-App Notifications
- Dashboard indicators
- Notification bell
- Incident widget

### External Channels

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Opsgenie" icon="bell" href="/space-intelligence/operations/integrations/opsgenie">
    2-way sync with Opsgenie alerts.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Webhooks" icon="globe" href="/space-intelligence/operations/integrations/webhooks">
    Send to any HTTP endpoint.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Configure channels in **Settings** → **Integrations**.

## Incident Reports

Generate incident reports:
1. Go to **Reports** → **Incidents**
2. Select time range
3. Filter by:
   - Severity
   - Robot/Collection
   - Location
   - Resolution status
4. Export as CSV or PDF

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with the basics">
    Begin with essential incidents (battery, connectivity) before adding complex conditions.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Avoid alert fatigue">
    Too many low-priority alerts train people to ignore them. Be selective.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use severity appropriately">
    Reserve Critical for truly urgent issues. Warning for "check when convenient."
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Set up escalation">
    Configure escalation for critical incidents that aren't acknowledged quickly.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Review and tune">
    Regularly review incident patterns and adjust thresholds to reduce noise.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
