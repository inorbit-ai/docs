InOrbit is a RobOps platform aimed at resolving common infrastructure needs and integrating into the broader robotics solution. Here you can find a menu of the different options you can choose from including SDKs, APIs and tools.

## Authentication

All API and SDK access is authenticated with the InOrbit system using an API Key which can be obtained and managed through [InOrbit Console](https://console.inorbit.ai), in the [API Key section](/ground-control/authentication). An API Key is always associated with a service user in your account and its access is managed using role-based access control.
