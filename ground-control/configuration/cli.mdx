This section explains how to install and configure InOrbit's CLI. The CLI allows you to apply, list, and clear configurations.

There are two methods for installing the CLI. The prerequisite is having either Python 3 or Docker installed, depending on installation method.

## Using the InOrbit CLI with Docker

The InOrbit CLI is distributed in a Docker image which is available on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/inorbitai/cli). To run the container, follow the commands below:

```bash
export INORBIT_CLI_API_KEY="account_api_key"
docker run -e INORBIT_CLI_API_KEY=$INORBIT_CLI_API_KEY -v $(pwd):$(pwd) -ti inorbitai/cli
```

<Info>
It is possible to mount a volume with all configuration files inside the container to make editing and applying them easier. This example uses the current working directory.
</Info>

## Installing the Package

The other method is to install the official Python package from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/inorbit-cli/).

```bash
pip install inorbit-cli
```

The [inorbit-cli](https://pypi.org/project/inorbit-cli/) package can be installed using `pip` by running the command above.

## Configuring Environment Variables

```shell
# Example configuration of environment variables for the CLI
export INORBIT_CLI_API_KEY="account_api_key"
export INORBIT_CLI_VERBOSE="true" #optional
```

Before using the CLI, you'll need to configure the `INORBIT_CLI_API_KEY` with your API key. You can get the API key from the [Developer Console](https://console.inorbit.ai).

The CLI verbose mode can be enabled by setting the `INORBIT_CLI_VERBOSE` environment variable to `true`.

## Getting Started with the CLI

By typing the `inorbit` or `inorbit --help` command, you will find the CLI's help.

The CLI provides the following main commands:

- `apply`: Applies a configuration object.
- `delete`: Deletes a configuration object.
- `get`: Lists or dumps configuration objects.
- `describe`: Get detailed information about configuration objects.

## Listing Tags and Robots

```bash
# Example output -> Collections
Collection 'Location' has 2 tags
==========  ========
tag name    tag id
==========  ========
HQ          hq
Lab         lab
==========  ========

# Example output -> Robots
name                 id  agent version    online    last seen
------------  ---------  ---------------  --------  --------------------------
Inorbito      foo        4.4.0            False     1970-01-01T00:00:00.000001

# Example output -> Tags
name               description                     collection id    collection name
-----------------  ------------------------------  ---------------  -----------------
hardware-problems  Marked with hardware problems.  tags             Other
HQ                 Headquarters.                   location         Location
```

To learn more about your entities, just run the `inorbit describe <entity>` command. You can query the following entities:

- **collections**: Describe all collections and detailed collection data.
- **robots**: Describe all robots and detailed robot data.
- **tags**: Describe all tags and detailed tag data.

## Applying a Configuration Object

The `apply` command can be used to create or update configuration objects. To apply a configuration object follow these steps:

1. Create a JSON file describing the configuration object. (The reference schemas for the different kinds are described in following sections)

2. Run `inorbit apply -f config_file.json`. If everything goes well, you'll see a message like `Configuration <config/file/path> applied successfully`.

3. You can use `inorbit get config --scope "<scope>" --kind "<kind>" "<object_id>" --dump` to check that the configuration object was correctly saved in InOrbit.

Refer to the [advanced configuration](/ground-control/configuration/overview#advanced-configuration-scopes) section for detailed documentation on how to use *scopes*.

The *kind* includes statuses, incident definition, etc. Find their reference in the following sections.

## Deleting a Configuration Object

To delete a configuration object, run `inorbit delete config --kind "<kind>" "<object_id>" --scope "<scope>"`.

You will receive an `ok` response if the configuration object was successfully deleted.

To make sure that the configuration object was deleted, run `inorbit get config --scope "<scope>" --kind "<kind>" "<object_id>"` and check that there are no results.

## Listing Configuration Objects

Example listing of all config objects of a given kind:

```shell
$ inorbit get config --scope "*" --kind "Kind"
id                kind                label       scope                      suppressed
----------------  ------------------  -------     -------------------------  ------------
foo               Kind                Battery     account/bar                False
bar               Kind                Other Label tag/baz/qux                False
baz               Kind                            robot/qux/quux             True
```

Example: Detailed JSON dump of all `IncidentDefinition` objects applying to the entire account:

```shell
$ inorbit get config --scope "tag/foo/bar" --kind "IncidentDefinition" --dump
[
  {
    "metadata": {
      "scope": "tag/foo/bar",
      "id": "bar"
    },
    "apiVersion": "v0.1",
    "spec": {

    },
    "kind": "IncidentDefinition"
  }
]
```

The CLI can query and list any kind of configuration objects using: `inorbit get config --scope "<scope>" --kind "<kind>"`.

The `--dump` option can also be used to dump the contents (in JSON form) of the objects instead of just listing them.

<Info>
By default the operation lists any configuration object defined for the account, but system defaults are hidden. They can be included adding the `--include-system-defaults` option.
