The `RobotFootprint` kind allows configuring the *footprint* of a robot. The footprint is the area that the robot occupies in a map and it is used for representing the robot in map views.

Unlike most other configurations in this section, `RobotFootprint` is a "global" config, meaning there can only be one per unique scope. For this reason, the only accepted `id` value is `"all"`.

The `spec` of a robot footprint configuration has the following properties:

- `footprint`: (Optional) Footprint shape, defined as a list of points of minimum length 3. Each point is an object with `x` and `y` properties, representing the position of the point in meters relative to the reported position of the robot. If not provided, the footprint will take a circular shape with a radius set by the `radius` property.
- `radius`: (Optional) Sets the size of the inner orientation indicator. If set to `0`, no indicator will be shown. If `footprint` is not provided, the radius of the circular footprint will be adjusted proportionally to this number.

**Note:** If only one of the two properties is provided, the other will be taken from the configuration applied to the robot's tag(s) or the configuration at the account level.
