Dashboards define the user experience for you and other users in your account.
They define what information is displayed to monitor and operate robot fleets, which is highly
dependent on the robots characteristics, monitoring and operational needs, and size of fleet among
other factors. Refer to [this document](https://www.inorbit.ai/docs#create-dashboards)
for an overview of what you can do with Dashboards and its related concepts: Sections and Widgets.

This section gives a specification for dashboards to configure them through Configuration APIs.
This is a rather advanced usage and allows to fine-tune the experience providing further control
on each configuration parameter as well as to apply Configuration Management practices to your
account. It is adviced to start with dashboards defined through the Settings interface, then
export them using the Config APIs with the CLI, for an easier start with a mostly configured dashboard.

Dashboards can be customized depending on robot types or other conditions.
Different widgets can appear to display only those that make sense to the selected robot,
as well as to offer only the actions that apply to this robot. Further detail on [Robot-based dashboards customization](#robot-based-customization).

Dashboards are configured through the `DashboardDefinition` kind, using a unique `id` and only
at `"account"` level. A dashboard must have a `label`, and can define a numeric `order` property
to define the order it appears as compared to order dashboards `order` value.

Each dashboard defines a list of `sections`. Sections also define a `label` or title.
They use a `withControlWidget` property to define if a control bar appears in the section,
allowing to select the current robot, or timeframe to display, or current filters.
it is normally recommended to have a control widget; except when multiple sections of the same
`scope` appear in the same dashboard.
Sections also have a `scope` that define the type of widgets that can appear in the section.
Valid scopes are:

 * `"fleet"`: To display information about a set of robots (or the entire fleet), such as
   an overview of all robots' statuses, a list of incidents, audit log, etc.
 * `"robot"`: A section that displays (normally current) information about a selected robot
 * `"navigation"`: Normally contains a single Navigation widget, which allows to view a robot
   in its map (position, planned path, costmap, traffic zones), with cameras and controls
   to tele-operate it.
 * `"timeCapsule"`: To contain [Time Capsules](https://www.inorbit.ai/docs#time-capsule),
   a tool to analyze past events on a robot around a given point in time to perform root cause
   analysis and optimize robot behavior.
 * `"mission"`: Reserved for widgets to display missions' metrics (KPIs). Note that this feature
   is not available on all Editions.

Sections can also be displayed or hidden conditionally (see below).

Sections contain a list of `widgets`, which are the actual contents and most important part
of a dashboard. There are many different widget types.
Every widget contains some common properties like a `label` and a `type` (see below), and a
`layout` defining its size and position.  Just like sections, widgets can also be displayed
conditionally (see below).

Depending on the widget `type`, each widget accepts its own parameters in a `config` object:
for example which data sources to display, or what actions to offer to execute, etc.
Valid options for `config` objects are listed below; except for widgets that do not have
any configuration options (they only accept an empty `{}` object).

### Fleet widgets

  * `"fleetStatus"`: The main widget to display the list of robots
  and their statuses (with Error, Warning, Ok). It can be configured with a list `statuses`, ids
  of `StatusDefinition` objects to display a specific list of statuses (by default it displays those
  configured globally in Settings UI).
  * `"incidentTimeline"`: A calendar-like timeline of incidents for the entire fleet (or selected robots).
  * `"incidentList"`: A listing incidents for the entire fleet (or selected robots). It works in sync
with the Incident Timeline, and allows jumping to Time Capsule to dig into the time window of an incident.
  * `"kpi"`: A widget with account-level KPIs such as number of robots, users/robots ratio, etc.
  * `"locations"`: A world map with indicators of your configured locations and their states; that
  can be zoomed in at location level to display its robots.
  * `"auditLogFleet"`: An audit log for the fleet or a selected set of robots.
  * `"fleetMissionTracker"`: A listing of missions already executed and being executed by the robots fleet.
  It allows zooming into past missions to debug in Time Capsule.

### Robot widgets

All robot widgets display information or act on a _selected_ robot, which can be selected from the
control widget or widgets that support selection (Fleet Status, Navigation).

***Data Sources***:

  * `"chart"`: A timeline chart displaying variation in values of multiple data sources.
  It displays a line chart by default, unless a `chartType` property is used (valid values: `"linechart"` and `"areachart"`).
  It requires a list `dataSources` objects with the data sources to display. Each data source must have an `id` and `label`, and can also specify a numeric `precision` and `scale` to adjust values; and also the operation
  to perform to aggregate values in time windows (one of `"average"`, `"count"`, `"maximum"`, `"minimum"`, `"sum"`, `"last"`).
  Scale in Y-axis is automatically adjusted, unless two properties `min` and `max` are given to fix the scale.
  See example on the right sidebar.
  * `"vitals"`: A widget that supports displaying up to 4 data sources values.
  Its `dataSources` list contains the data sources identified with `id` and `label`.
  An optional `unit` can be specified for each data source, as well as a `type` of visualization:
  a `"text"` representation of a `"gauge"` used normally with numeric values.
  * `"listData"`: It displays several data sources in a table. It is configured similarly to `"vitals"`,
  with a list of `dataSources` with `id`, `label` and `precision`.
  * `"keyValues"`: It displays a list of all key-value pairs reported by the robot with their most recent updatd timestamp.
  * `"history"`: It displays a table with the most recent updates received to a specific data source,
  and their timestamps.
  * `"stateTransitions"`: Similarly to `chart`, it displays a timeline of several data sources;
  with colored bars representing how long each data source stays in a given value and changing colors
  when those states change. It is configured with a `dataSources` list of objects with `id` and `label`.

***Monitoring and operation***:

  * `"localization"`: A small version of the Navigation widget (see next _scope_), displaying the robot
  in a small map.
  * `"actions"`: Displays configured actions that can be execute on the robot. All configured actions
  are displayed, except if a list of strings `actionIds` is explicitly given to limit the selection.
  Two other boolean values can be used to tweak the appearance: `expanded` will auto-expand action groups,
  and `bigButtons` displays larger buttons (useful for dashboards prepared for mobile devices).
  * `"cameraWidget"`: A widget displaying the a live camera. It is configured with a single `cameraId`
  string that identifies the camera to display.
  * `"tagsAndModes"`: A listing of all tags assigned to a robot, including its current Mode. It also
  allows editing those tags.
  * `"missionTracker"`: It displays the most recent missions executed by the selected robot.

***Auditing***:

  * `"auditLog"`: Displays a log of the most recent events of the robot (or those events in the selected
  time window).
  * `"diagnostics"`: A visualization of data reported as ROS Diagnostics, for ROS-based robots.
  * `"dataBags"`: A listing of _rosbags_ and other files (logs, etc.) configured to be collected by the robot.
  Each file has an option to be uploaded from the robot to the cloud (to later download it, without the
  user needing to connect to the robot).

### Navigation widgets

  * `"navigation"`: The only widget for a Navigation dashboard.
  It displays a map with the current position of the robot in its map, displaying (if reported) its
  paths, costmap, lidars readings and camera images.
  It can also display other robots in the area, as well as map features
  such as traffic zones, named waypoints, etc.
  Additionally, if supported by the robot and configured, it also allows doing teleoperation.

### Time Capsule widgets

These widgets are specialized versions of some widgets already listed above; with the excpetion that
they do not show "live" data but instead are controlled through the Time Capsule toolbar, to display
past data at specific points in time.

  * `"timeCapsuleMap"`: A version of `"navigation"` to work within Time Capsule.
  * `"timeCapsuleSegmentLogs'"`: A version of `stateTransitions` to work within Time Capsule
  * `"timeCapsuleAuditLogs"`: A version of `auditLog` to work within Time Capsule
  * `"timeCapsuleDataBags"` A version of `dataBags` to work within Time Capsule

### Mission widgets

```yaml
apiVersion: v0.1
kind: DashboardDefinition
metadata:
  id: my-dashboard
  scope: account

            type: "string"
            config:
              attributeIds:
                - "data.label"
          - id: "robotName"
            label: "robot name"
            type: "string"
            config:
              attributeIds:

          - id: "startTs"
            label: "Start"
            type: "time"
            config:
              attributeIds:
                - "startTs"
          - id: "endTs"
            label: "End"
            type: "time"
            config:
              attributeIds:
                - "endTs"
          - id: "duration"
            label: "Duration"
            type: "withUnit"
            config:
              attributeIds:
                - "data.duration"
              unit: "ms"
      label: Mission KPI
      layout:
        grid: 12
        withoutBackground: true
      type: missionKPI
    withControlWidget: true
```

  * `"missionDefinitions"`: It displays mission definitions and their steps.
  It also allows dispatching missions for their execution.
  * `"missionKPI"`: It displays aggregated information on missions executed by the fleet, allowing
  to perform various filters such as by time, robot tags, mission results. It can be configured with:
    - `kpis`: A list of KPI definitions to display, each with a `kpiDefinitionId` that references a configured KPI.
    - `tableColumns`: A list of column configurations for the mission data table. Each column includes:
      - `id`: Unique identifier for the column
      - `label`: Display name for the column header
      - `type`: Column data type (e.g., "statusChip", "string", "time", "withUnit")
      - `config`: Configuration object containing:
        - `attributeIds`: Array of field paths to extract data from KPI objects. All, but `statusChip` type columns, accept any number of attributes in the `attributeIds` list.
        In this case, the first attribute that exists in the KPI object will be used.
        For `statusChip` type columns, `attributeIds` is ignored. The mission state and status are used to determine the status chip.
        - `unit`: Unit of measurement (for "withUnit" type columns). It's used to display the value with the unit in the table. 
        For known units, like "m" and "ms", data values are assumed to be in the set unit and the value is converted to whichever unit is more convenient for display.

See [KPI Definitions](#configuring-kpi-definitions) section for more details on the fields available for KPI objects.



## Conditional functionality

```json
{
    "kind": "DashboardDefinition",
    "apiVersion": "v0.1",
    "metadata": {
        "id": "my-dashboard",
        "scope": "account"
    },
    "spec": {
        "sections": [{
          "label": "A conditional section",
          "conditional": {
            "tags": ["only-this-tag"]
          },
          "widgets": [...]
        }]
    }
}
```

To allow conditional display of widgets or entire sections, both elements allow to be toggled on
only if the current robot has been assigned a tag. This allows creating dashboards that will
display differently for different robots.
See [Robot-based Customization](#robot-based-customization) section for more details.

The configuration for this feature is given by an object like `{ "conditional": { "tags": ["my-tag"] } }`,
specifying either in a section or a widget that will only be displayed if the robot contains tag "my-tag".
