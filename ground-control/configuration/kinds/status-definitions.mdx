*Status definitions* allows setting up rules to flag different problems in robots.
For example, a battery level dropping below a threshold, a sustained low motor speed, or a specific data source receiving an unexpected value.
Statuses are [visualized in Fleet dashboards](https://www.inorbit.ai/docs?hsLang=en#look-at-inorbit).
and also serve as the source for defining Incidents -- see next section.

Each Status may take three values: OK, WARNING and ERROR. They are displayed in different colors in dashboards. To determine these values, a `StatusDefinition` is configured with a number of rules: the first one to match the current robot condition determines the status value.

Each rule contains the `status` value to assign (`OK`, `WARNING` or `ERROR`). The rule is defined by a function, one of `EQUAL`, `NOT_EQUALS`, `BELOW`, `ABOVE` or `CONTAINS`, which can be combined with an optional `sustainedForSeconds`. The `sustainedForSeconds` value ensures the rule is only triggered after the conditions are met for the specified amount of time. The argument(s) for the function are set in `params`, as a list of values. For example, to indicate *if the temperature has been greater than 85 for over a minute*, one would define `{ "function": "ABOVE", "params": [85], "sustainedForSeconds": 60 }`.

A Status can be evaluated based on a data source value (see [Data Sources](#data-sources)). In this case, the `` must match an existing data source id (and does not have a `calculated` object in its `spec`.
In the previous example, the `statusId` would be the ID of motor temperature's data source.
Alternatively, an **advanced** `StatusDefinition` can be defined using an arbitrary expression, using multiple data sources or robot tags. In this case, the `calculated` field must contain:

- A `expression` string in InOrbit's [expression language](/ground-control/concepts/expressions-language#expressions-language). This allows evaluating an arbitrary condition, such as _"If a robot with the 'prod' tag is not moving and its current program is 'delivery'"_.
- Optionally a `filter` can determine *if* the status is to be computed. This allows skipping computation. For example, when using a rich JSON data source as an input, certain messages can be skipped and will not update the status.

Expressions can use values from any robot data source, combine them with comparisons and logical operators, use aggregations on data sources, and even localization-related functions. See [expression language reference](/ground-control/concepts/expressions-language#expressions-language) below.

_Note: The number of **advanced** `StatusDefinitions` is limited in Free Edition. See [pricing page](https://www.inorbit.ai/pricing?hsLang=en)._

Once a Status changes its value to Warning or Error, this can trigger an *incident*. Refer to `IncidentDefinition` config objects below.
