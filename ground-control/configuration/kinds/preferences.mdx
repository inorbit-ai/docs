```json
{
    "kind": "Preferences",
    "apiVersion": "v0.1",
    "metadata": {
        "id": "all",
        "scope": "account"
    },
    "spec": {
        "navigationWidget": {
            "panels": {
              "teleop": false
            },
            "actions": ["action1", "action2"]
        }
    }
}
```

Additionally to their configuration given in Dashboards, some parts of the user interface may
be adjusted using the `Preferences` kind.
This also includes global properties that apply to all widgets if a given type.
And most importantly, `Preferences` can be applied at different scopes ("account", "tag" or "robot")
so the preference will be applied differently depending on the selected robot.

Currently, only Navigation widget allows setting Preferences. They include:

  * `panels`: An object with panel names that can be hidden. Its keys can be `"teleop"`, `"camera"`, `"gauges"`, `"localization"` and `"background"`.
  By setting any of these values to `false`, the Navigation widget will not display them.
  This is useful for example when a robot does not implement a feature or simply teleoperating it is not desired.
  * `actions`: A list of ids of actions to display in the Navigation toolbar, which allow
  for quick execution of actions while monitoring the robot. Applying these `Preferences`
  at the correct scopes, one could only offer actions that apply to a robot type, or robots
  in a specific location for example.
