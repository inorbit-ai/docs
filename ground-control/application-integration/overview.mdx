This section describes different ways to integrate InOrbit and third-party applications, including the use of REST APIs and Embeds.

- **InOrbit REST APIs**: Provide programmatic access to InOrbit's functionality and are best suited for integrating with backend services.

- **Embeds**: Allow developers to build and embed dashboards containing robot or fleet level information into any applications using no-code.

- **Configuration as Code**: Allow customers to configure all InOrbit settings using code.

- **Incident Management**: Handle and manage robot incidents programmatically through APIs and webhooks.

The following sections describe REST APIs, Embeds, Configuration as Code, and Incident Management in detail.
