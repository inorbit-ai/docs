InOrbit offers REST and streaming APIs that enable programmatic access to InOrbit features. Using these APIs you can fetch data related to your robots, trigger actions, integrate with incident management systems and more.

## Overview

The InOrbit REST API provides programmatic access to all major InOrbit features. All API endpoints are authenticated using app keys. See [Authentication](/ground-control/authentication) for details on obtaining and using your API keys.
