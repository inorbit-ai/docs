There are several ways to connect robots to InOrbit, depending on your robot platform and architecture.

## Which Method Should I Use?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="ROS-based robots" icon="robot" defaultOpen>
    **Use the InOrbit Agent** — Our recommended approach for ROS and ROS 2 robots. The agent runs on your robot, handles secure communication, and provides native ROS topic integration.

  <Accordion title="Non-ROS robots or fleet managers" icon="server">
    **Use a pre-built Connector** — We maintain open-source connectors for popular platforms like MiR, OTTO, and Gausium. Connectors can run on your edge infrastructure or be hosted by InOrbit in our cloud.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Custom integration" icon="code">
    **Build your own** — Use our SDKs to create a custom integration:
    
    - **Robot SDK** — Runs on the robot alongside the InOrbit Agent. Best for adding custom data to ROS robots or non-ROS robots where you can install the agent.
    - **Edge SDK** — Runs on an edge server, no agent required. Best for integrating fleet managers or systems where you can't install software on robots.

## Comparison

| Method | Best For | Runs On | Agent Required |
|--------|----------|---------|----------------|
| **InOrbit Agent** | ROS/ROS 2 robots | Robot | — (is the agent) |
| **Connectors** | MiR, OTTO, Gausium, fleet managers | Edge or InOrbit Cloud | No |
| **Robot SDK** | Custom robot software | Robot | Yes |
| **Edge SDK** | Fleet managers, custom integrations | Edge or cloud | No |

## Interoperability Standards

InOrbit also supports industry standards for robot interoperability:

- **MassRobotics AMR Interoperability Standard**
- **VDA 5050** — Communication interface for AGVs/AMRs
- **Open-RMF** — Open Robotics Middleware Framework
