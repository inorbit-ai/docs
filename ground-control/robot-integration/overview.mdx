description: "Connect robots to InOrbit platform"
---

This section describes tools and libraries that can be used to connect robots to InOrbit. The connection can be made from the individual robots or from servers running on the edge.

Depending on the selected solution architecture, you can pick one of the following SDKs:

- **Robot SDK** helps developers implement a bidirectional communication channel between robots and InOrbit. It can be used to feed robot data into InOrbit and then implement actions, such as teleoperation and more. The Robot SDK also streamlines integration with ROS and ROS2 by allowing developers to map ROS topics to InOrbit using simple configuration files.
- **Edge SDK** simplifies the integration with third-party or custom applications, like fleet managers, or warehouse management systems. It can be used to feed data gathered by edge servers into InOrbit.

The following sections describe both SDKs in detail and provides examples of their usage.
