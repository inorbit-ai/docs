description: "Connect ROS robots with the InOrbit Agent"
---

The **InOrbit Agent** is the recommended way to connect ROS and ROS 2 robots to InOrbit. It runs directly on your robot, providing:

- **Native ROS integration** — Automatic discovery of topics, maps, and cameras
- **Secure communication** — Encrypted, optimized data channel to InOrbit cloud
- **Adaptive sampling** — Smart throttling to minimize bandwidth
- **Offline buffering** — Data is queued when connectivity is lost
- **Scripted actions** — Execute commands on your robot from InOrbit
- **Video streaming** — Stream camera feeds to InOrbit Control

## Quick Start

### 1. Get Your Account Key

Log in to [InOrbit Console](https://console.inorbit.ai) and navigate to **Add Robot**. Copy your account key.

### 2. Install the Agent

Run this one-line command on your robot (replace `YOUR_ACCOUNT_KEY`):

```bash
curl "https://control.inorbit.ai/liftoff/YOUR_ACCOUNT_KEY" | sh
```

Follow the prompts to complete installation. The agent will start automatically and your robot will appear in InOrbit Control.

<Info>
By default, the robot name is its hostname. You can change this during installation or later in InOrbit Console.
</Info>

### 3. Verify Connection

Check that the agent is running:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000
```

You should see: `"InOrbit Agent API: OK"`

## Installation Options

### Debian Package

For production deployments, install the agent as a Debian package:

```bash
curl "https://control.inorbit.ai/liftoff/YOUR_ACCOUNT_KEY?variant=deb" | sh
```

### Agent Core Only

If you're using the Robot SDK and only need the core agent (without ROS integration):

```bash
curl "https://control.inorbit.ai/liftoff/YOUR_ACCOUNT_KEY?variant=core" | sh
```

## ROS Integration

The agent automatically detects and subscribes to common ROS topics. You can customize which topics are mapped to InOrbit from [InOrbit Console](https://console.inorbit.ai) under robot settings.

### Publishing Custom Data

You can publish custom key-value data to InOrbit via ROS topics:

```bash
# ROS 1
rostopic pub /inorbit/custom_data/0 std_msgs/String "battery=55"
rostopic pub /inorbit/custom_data/0 std_msgs/String "status=docked"

# ROS 2
ros2 topic pub /inorbit/custom_data/0 std_msgs/String "data: 'battery=55'"
```

## Configuration

Agent configuration is stored in `~/.inorbit/local/`. Key files:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `agent.env.sh` | Environment variables (API port, binding address) |
| `inorbit_agent.log` | Agent logs |

### Common Configuration

Edit `~/.inorbit/local/agent.env.sh` to customize:

```bash
# Port for SDK communication (default: 5000)
INORBIT_AGENT_API_PORT=5000

# Binding address (default: localhost)
INORBIT_AGENT_API_BINDING=localhost
```

## Troubleshooting

<Warning>
If your robot doesn't appear in InOrbit Control, check the agent logs at `~/.inorbit/local/inorbit_agent.log`. Contact [support@inorbit.ai](mailto:support@inorbit.ai) if you need help.
