**Connectors** are lightweight applications that bridge robots or fleet managers to InOrbit. They use the [Edge SDK](/ground-control/robot-integration/edge-sdk) to send robot data to InOrbit and can handle bidirectional communication for actions and missions.

Use a connector when:
- Your robots use a proprietary fleet manager (MiR, OTTO, Gausium, etc.)
- You want to integrate robots that expose an API
- You can't or don't want to install software directly on robots

All connectors are open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/inorbit-ai/inorbit-robot-connectors).

## Deployment Options

Connectors can be deployed in two ways:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Edge Deployment">
    Deploy the connector on your own infrastructure within your network.
    
    **Best for:**
    - Full control over infrastructure
    - Existing edge compute resources
    - Air-gapped or restricted networks
    
    **Requirements:**
    - Linux server (Ubuntu 20.04+ recommended) or Docker
    - Network access to robot/fleet manager API
    - Outbound internet access to InOrbit cloud
    
    **You manage:** Infrastructure, updates, monitoring
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Managed Cloud (Recommended)">
    InOrbit hosts and manages the connector in our cloud infrastructure.
    
    **Best for:**
    - Minimal operational overhead
    - No dedicated edge infrastructure
    - Simplified network configuration
    
    **How it works:**
    - Secure tunnel (frpc) runs on a lightweight machine in your network
    - Connector runs in InOrbit cloud, communicates through the tunnel
    - No inbound firewall rules needed — connection is outbound only
    - All traffic is encrypted with secret key authentication
    
    **You manage:** Only the lightweight tunnel client

## How Connectors Work

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│ Robot or        │ ←── │ Connector   │ ──→ │ InOrbit     │
│ Fleet Manager   │     │ (Edge SDK)  │     │ Cloud       │
└─────────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
```

The connector:
1. Polls your robot or fleet manager API for status
2. Transforms data into InOrbit format
3. Publishes to InOrbit via Edge SDK
4. Handles bidirectional actions (missions, commands)

## Building Your Own Connector

If there's no pre-built connector for your platform, you can create one using our Python framework:

### inorbit-connector Package

The [`inorbit-connector`](https://pypi.org/project/inorbit-connector/) Python package provides a base structure for building connectors:

```bash
pip install inorbit-connector
```

```python
from inorbit_connector import InOrbitConnector

class MyConnector(InOrbitConnector):
    def fetch_robot_data(self):
        # Poll your robot or fleet manager API
        # Return robot positions, status, etc.
        pass
```

## Connector Configuration

Most connectors use YAML configuration files. Example for MiR:

```yaml
# fleet.yaml
fleet_manager:
  host: "mir-fleet.example.com"
  username: "admin"
  password: "secret"

robots:
  - mir_id: "MiR_123"
    inorbit_id: "robot-001"
```

Each connector has specific configuration options documented in its README.
